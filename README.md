# IMDB-database

Complete a series of guided prompts exploring the top-rated movies on IMDB. IMDB stands for "the Internet Movie Database," an online collection of film information and reviews.

In these exercises, I will be looking to answer such questions as:

* What is the average rating per genre?
* How many different actors are in a movie?

The IMDB dataset provided is created from data scraped from the [Internet Movie Database website](https://www.imdb.com. The dataset describes top ranking movies, including: title, data, duration, content rating, headlining actors, and ranking.
